This is the code collation that I follow when I watch Yin Cheng's machine learning video. It mainly includes decision tree, neural network, logical regression, K-means, knn, SVM, Naive Bayesian, etc. It will include some examples, which will be uploaded continuously later. Welcome to study together.
